## 🔐 Technical Implementation Notes

### Subscription Check Middleware

```python
def check_marketplace_access(user):
    """
    Check if user has active marketplace subscription.
    """
    farm = user.farm
    
    # Check if farm has active subscription
    if not farm.subscription:
        return False, "No marketplace subscription"
    
    subscription = farm.subscription
    
    # Check subscription status
    if subscription.status in ['active', 'trial']:
        return True, "Marketplace access granted"
    
    elif subscription.status == 'past_due':
        days_left = subscription.days_until_suspension
        return True, f"Grace period: {days_left} days remaining"
    
    else:  # suspended, cancelled
        return False, "Marketplace subscription inactive"
```

### Feature Access Control

```python
class MarketplaceFeature:
    """Decorator to require marketplace subscription"""
    
    def __init__(self, feature_name):
        self.feature_name = feature_name
    
    def __call__(self, func):
        def wrapper(request, *args, **kwargs):
            has_access, message = check_marketplace_access(request.user)
            
            if not has_access:
                return Response({
                    'error': 'Marketplace subscription required',
                    'message': message,
                    'upgrade_url': '/subscriptions/plans/'
                }, status=403)
            
            return func(request, *args, **kwargs)
        
        return wrapper

# Usage
@api_view(['POST'])
@MarketplaceFeature('create_product_listing')
def create_product_listing(request):
    """Create product listing - requires subscription"""
    # ... create listing logic
```
